H2 Maven Plugin

  The H2 Maven Plugin makes it easy to manipulate
  {{{http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html}H2 database}} instances
  from within a Maven environment.  This is most useful during
  integration and unit testing.

* Goals Overview

  * {{{./spawn-mojo.html}h2:spawn}}
    Spawns an H2 TCP server.

  * {{{./stop-mojo.html}h2:stop}}
    Stops a previously spawned H2 TCP server.

* Usage

  General instructions on how to use the Plugin Name can be found on
  the {{{./usage.html}usage page}}. Some more specific use cases are
  described in the examples given below.

  If you feel like the plugin is missing a feature or has a defect,
  you can fill out a feature request or bug report in our
  {{{./issue-tracking.html}issue tracker}}. When creating a new issue,
  please provide a comprehensive description of your
  concern. Especially for fixing bugs it is crucial that the
  developers can reproduce your problem. For this reason, entire debug
  logs, POMs or most preferably little demo projects attached to the
  issue are very much appreciated.  Of course, patches are welcome,
  too. Contributors can check out the project from our
  {{{./source-repository.html}source repository}} and will find
  supplementary information in the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-helping.html}guide
  to helping with Maven}}.

  Maven Plugin, you can take a look into the following examples:
